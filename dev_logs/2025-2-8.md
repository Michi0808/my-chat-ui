## Completed Tasks:

### **Modified Scrollbar Design**

1. **Applied SimpleBar to DataList.tsx:**

   - Initially applied SimpleBar to the DataList.tsx component.
   - However, it was decided to abandon the idea as it caused the Cardâ€™s width to become too narrow.

   - Added `::-webkit-scrollbar` to `index.css`.
   - Verified that the scrollbar was correctly updated.
